This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked HTML error: a missing closing tag.  The bug.html file contains an HTML document missing its closing </html> tag. This seemingly small omission can lead to unpredictable rendering results and may cause issues with HTML validation and browser compatibility. The bugSolution.html file shows the corrected version with the missing closing tag added.
